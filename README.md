MARBALLS README
===============

This readme, for the duration of this project, should serve as our agreement on various standards on this project.
Coding standards, formatting standards, and resources and references should be mentioned in this document.

CODING STANDARDS
================

	GITHUB NOTICE: Before you make any changes to a file, use the pull command to get the most up to date versions of the file.

	It is Kyle's personal preference that:
		- Class names and functions begin with capital letters, including contained words.
			(ex. Vector, VectorMath, Calculate())
		- Variable names should use camelCasing. CONSTANTS ARE ALL CAPS, ALL THE TIME.
			(ex. bool marbleShooter, int bonzaiBalls, const int CRUISECONTROL = 1337)
		- Variable names should reflect their purpose unless they are used in an iterator or loop counter.
			(ex. If a variable stores a normal vector, why not name it normVector or something?)
		- Comments that fit should be inline using // so as to not use extravagant amounts of space.
			(ex. if (42 > 69) {...} // This checks if fundamental math has ceased working properly.)
		- Functions should have a preceding comment including their name and purpose.
			(ex. // MarbleRoll - Rolls a marble so hard it becomes a biscuit.)
		- Opening brackets { be placed on the line that beckoned them.
			(ex. if (README == "boring") {\n return "sorry for standards"; \n}
		- Every code file should have a comment section on top denoting its name, purpose, date of last revision, and tasks to do.
			(ex. thing_stuffer.h \n Thing that does stuff. \n Last Revised: Tomorrow \n To Do: - Exist)
	
	Chris has set the standard that file names, at the very least header files, should be lower case with underscore spacing.
	(Not going to go against that standard because github makes it hell to change casing after the fact.)
	
	If anyone else has particular formatting they care for, write so in the README or forever hold your keys.
	Once a set of formatting standards are approved, Kyle will check for inconsistencies and correct them (without nagging!)

RESOURCES AND REFERENCES
========================
	- Shove anything here you find useful that is linkable. It's nice to mention it here because github will notify of the change.
	- General advice is nice too, like tips for using github or git.
