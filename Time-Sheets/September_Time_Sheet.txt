9/24/2014:
	Group (15 min):
	(Meeting) Topics discussed:
		- Having better communication, part of this is because Chris needs to set up the project management tool
		- Timeline has been set, 4 chapters of implementation must be completed every 2 weeks
		- Time sheet created, start keeping track of how long tasks take you and total work time
		- Version history needs to be updated at the end of a day when changes are made
		- Regular working times need to be set up when tasks become assigned. Possible pair programming in the future.

	Brenton(3 hours total):
	(5 min) - Updated particle.h and initialized the integrate function.
	(55 min) - Implementation of integrate function in particle.cpp / Learned to use Github application.
	(120 min) - Debugging / Testing (Tried using completed files from authorâ€™s Github for Chapter 4 test scenario).
		
	Chris (1 hour total):
	(40 min) - Read and started to implement the particle.h header file, did not get to the integrator
	(5  min) - created the particle.cpp source file, just head comments
	(5  min) - fixed the engine_core.h, capitalized all Vector3 functions and class name
	(10 min) - created marballs.h header file, a global include that simply includes all of the headers we create
